# Wiki Link Verification Tool

> ⚠️ **Heads Up!** This project is in alpha stage. The basics are working, but there's still lots of room for improvement. Your feedback and ideas are super welcome!

A tool built to make wiki contributors' lives easier when managing and checking resource links. It automates the tedious parts of link verification so you can focus on what matters - making sure the content is actually good!

## Where We're At

The first alpha version is out! While the basic features are up and running, there's still plenty more to come. The project is actively being worked on with lots of improvements planned.

What's Working:
- Basic URL verification
- SSL certificate checking
- Site information extraction

Coming Soon:
- More automated checks
- Better user interface
- Extended verification options
- Export capabilities
- And plenty more good stuff!

## What's This About?

Managing wiki resource links is tough, especially when dealing with user submissions. This tool was born from the experience of manually checking hundreds of links (not fun!) and aims to make the whole process smoother and more organized.

## What It Does (and Will Do)

The tool helps you:
- Check if websites are still alive and kicking
- Verify SSL certificates and security
- See if sites work well on mobile
- Pull useful info like descriptions and keywords
- Keep your verification notes organized
- Track content quality
- Manage related links (Discord, Telegram, etc.)

## Why Build This?

After spending way too much time manually checking links and trying to keep track of everything in scattered notes, it became clear we needed a better way. This tool aims to help clear that backlog of unverified links that keeps growing in wiki projects.

## License

This project is open source under the MIT License - basically, you can do whatever you want with it! See the LICENSE file for the formal details.
